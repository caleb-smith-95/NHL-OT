    "There are many possible ways to estimate the number of points Team A is expected to pick up when playing Team B. Probably the most straight-forward is to simulate a number of matchups between teams A and B, and calculate the average number of points Team A earns per game. To do this, I have assumed the number of goals an NHL team scores in a given game is a Poisson random variable, with lambda being the goals per game scored by each team. I then built a function that inputs the goals per game of two generic NHL teams (Team A and Team B), and simulates \"iters\" number of games between these two teams. This function returns a dataframe containing three numbers:\n",
    "- the number of games won by Team A (the number of times in \"iters\" sims where Team A scored more goals than Team B)\n",
    "- the number of games won by Team B (same thing but in reverse)\n",
    "- the number of games in which both teams were tied at the end of regulation"

    "We now come to the game theory portion of this analysis: when should 2 teams agree to \"intentionally\" take a game into OT. As was discussed in my article, the first criteria is that the teams should be in opposite conferences. The second criteria is a bit more technical: any time both teams are expected to leave a game with less than 1.5 points, they should agree to take it into OT. The reasoning is simple: if we assume that OT is a 50/50 affair, then the expected outcome of an OT game for both teams is 1.5 points. This is obviously better for both teams than an expected outcome below this.\n",

    "NOTE: a major assumption I'm making in this analysis (and certainly the worst one I make) is that the number of goals a team is expected to score is not affected by the team they are playing. Obviously, this is not a good assumption. Some teams have good defenses and/or goalies that make it harder for a team to hit their average; others have bad defenses and/or goalies that make it likely that a team will exceed their average. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this complicates the analysis dramatically, and I am skeptical that this complication would drastrically change my conclusion. The reason for this is that accounting for defense and goaltending would not alter the above coordiante list at all. Rather, it would simply change the number of real-world games that fall within it. While this does affect the remainder of my analysis, it doesn't affect anything I've done up to this point. Therefore, for the sake of my Medium article, I decided the cost of this complication wasn't worth the benefit of a slight uptick in accuracy. As you will see from my conclusion, not many teams fall within this range, and I don't have reason to believe that would change much from updating the precision of the real-life numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, I encourage anyone who is interested in taking this analysis further by accounting for defense and goalkeeping to do so. If you have any ideas on how to do this, please contact me at caleb.r.smith95@outlook.com"
